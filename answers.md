- **b.** 
  - Work: W(n) = W(n-1) + O(1)
  - Span: S(n) = S(n-1) + O(1)
  - Work and span are both O(n).


- **d.**
  - Work: W(n) = 2W(n/2) + O(1)
  - Span: S(n) = W(n/2) + O(1)
  - So, work and span are both O(log n).


- **f.**
- The work is done in W(n) = 2W(n/2) + O(1), and the span is done in S(n) = W(n/2) + O(1) (parallel).**
